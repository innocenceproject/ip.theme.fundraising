          <div>The Innocence Project, founded in 1992 at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law by civil rights attorneys Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, provides pro bono post-conviction legal assistance to persons whose claims of innocence might be demonstrably proven by DNA testing. </div>
          <br />
 
          <div>DNA testing has exonerated more than 290 people in the United States since 1989, including seventeen who were sentenced to death. Each wrongful conviction represents a tragic lapse of our nation's commitment to ensuring the freedom and safety of its people. Yet each exoneration proves that we can address the systemic defects that have been proven to lead to the conviction of innocent men and women.</div>
          <br />
 
          <div>The donations we receive help the Innocence Project continue to free the innocent and reaffirm the basic promise of our justice system. To learn more, please visit <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org">www.innocenceproject.org</a>.</div>
